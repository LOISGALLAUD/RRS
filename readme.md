## Description

Project brought by Mr. LALLEMENT and Mr. FAISAN, teachers at Télécom Physique Strasbourg in the context of the course "Concepts of Object Oriented Programming".
This project is a simple rigid re-scaler, which means that it will keep the ratio of the image and will not deform it.

## How to use

Clone the repository and run the following command in the root directory of the project:

```bash
mkdir build && cd build && cmake .. && make && cd .. && ./bin/rrs
```
